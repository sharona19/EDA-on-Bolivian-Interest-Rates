Database source: This dataset contains the weekly summary of the interest rates both active and passive reported by the Bolivian financial institutions to the Bolivian Central Bank. Database availabe on https://www.bcb.gob.bo/webdocs/tasas_interes

The dataset, sourced from the Bolivian Central Bank, requires thorough examination due to various data issues. The EDA process involves extracting, cleansing, and mining the data.
Outliers, non-available values (zeros), and messy categorical values are identified during this stage. Through data visualization and descriptive statistics, patterns and anomalies are uncovered, aiding in the understanding of data quality and structure.

The EDA findings serve as a foundation for data cleaning and preprocessing steps, ensuring the dataset is ready for further analysis. By addressing data issues, this project lays the groundwork for reliable insights into the Bolivian financial system's passive interest rates.
